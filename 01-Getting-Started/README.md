# Getting Started

## What is Angular

Angular is a **JavaScript Framework** which allows you to create reactive **Single-Page Applications** (SPA's).

**Versions of Angular**

- Angular 1 => called _AngularJS_
- Angular 2 to ... => just called _Angular_

Angular 2 was a complete re-write of Angular 1. AngularJS and Angular are NOT related.

## Installing & Starting a Project

**Angular CLI**

- CLI stands for Command Line Interface
- Make sure NodeJS is installed

**First steps**

- Install the Angular CLI with the command: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Create a new project by using the CLI: `ng new my-dream-app`
- Navigate into the newly created folder: `ng my-dream-app`
- Start a development server: `ng serve`

## Edit the App

Angular works with so called components. Each component has a .html, .css and a .ts file. By editing the files, you can customize your components.<br>
There are a lot of ways to do this. All the features (Data Binding, Property Binding, Styling, Routing, ...) are covered in the next modules.

## Basic App

The _'Basic App Setup'_ is an empty project with [Bootstrap v3.4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/) included.
